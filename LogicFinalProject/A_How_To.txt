-Clicking on a proof bubble or subproof square will select said object
 (it will turn blue)
-hovering over a proof bubble will show all the info for it
 (label, sentence, justification)
-you can scroll in and out with a mouse scroll wheel
-you can drag the camera around

Add Step:
-adds a proof bubble to the graph
-requires you to enter a sentence and choose a justification from
 a drop-down menu

Verify Step:
-verifies if the step is correct (will turn green if correct, red
 if incorrect)
-requires you to select a node in order to verify
-there must be an arrow between the node that you want to verify and the
 reason(s) for it
-you need to exit add arrow mode in order to verify a step

Add Arrows
-will start and turn off "add arrow mode" where you can add an arrow between
 two nodes (either between two proof bubbles or between a proof bubble and a
  subproof bubble)
 -a green box will be next to the button while in add arrow mode
-in order to add the arrow click on (in this order - elsewise the arrows get
 messed up)
    * the proof/subproof node that the arrow should start at
    * the proof/subproof node that the arrow should end at
    * then hit the 'A' key on the keyboard

Start Subproof
-click to start "subproof mode"
-a purple box will be next to the button while in subproof mode
-subproof mode basically makes a subproof and allows you to add
 steps to it

End Subproof

Restart
-clears the entire graph (can use if you make a mistake)

Quit
-exits the application
